Guava
---------
An app for sharing the appliances you rarely use which are currently collecting dust.

Forked from an application developed during a University of Alberta Winter 2016 CMPUT 301 Group project, [papaya](https://github.com/CMPUT301W16T03/papaya).

Renters
-------
Take a picture of what you want to rent out, give it a spiffy title, provide a description, and guava will find a nearby renter who will give you cash fast to borrow your stuff.

Borrowers
---------
Type in some keywords and papaya will find in your area what you are looking for. See a picture of it so you know what you are getting. Place a bid, and soon you will have an affordible item in your hands to use.
